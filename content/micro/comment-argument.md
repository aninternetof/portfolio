I'm reading [an article comparing ant colonies to the human brain](http://nautil.us/issue/23/dominoes/ants-swarm-like-brains-think-rp) for class.
The article is fine; the comment section is GOLD.
Pure, too-bad-about-the-Internet gold.
I want [ReplyAll](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all) to find these [two](https://disqus.com/by/royniles/comments/) [guys](https://disqus.com/by/jvkohl/) and interview them.

This goes for PAGES. ReplyAll mid-episode plot twist: they're the same dude.
