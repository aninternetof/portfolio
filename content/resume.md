* Own our services through deployment and ensure high reliability using NewRelic, SumoLogic, and PagerDuty
* Work closely with the product team to understand customer needs and define new features for our roadmap
* Created a system to allow other teams to configure Flink and Hadoop with YAML to create records in Druid and ElasticSearch using data from any Kafka topic

### Co-founder, [Rovercode](https://rovercode.com/)
*2016-present*

I co-founded an online social learning platform where students write code for robots.

* Develop services in Python 3 (Django) and Go and our UI using React+Redux and Material-UI
* Drove down the cost of our infrastructure using AWS Lambda, Docker, AWS ECS+Fargate, and Cloudformation; set up CI/CD with TravisCI and GitHub Actions
* Defined and implemented a Web Bluetooth serial protocol to allow reliable communication with the robot directly from the browser

### Electrical Engineer + Firmware Engineer, [Indesign LLC](https://indesign-llc.com/)

I designed hardware, firmware, and programmable logic for turn-key electronic
products.

* Wrote custom Linux drivers in C for new cameras and displays
* Developed a low-latency Android audio stack for a custom high-performance device


### Math Teacher, [M.S.D. of Pike Township](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_School_District_of_Pike_Township)
